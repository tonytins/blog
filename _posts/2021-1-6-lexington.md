[Video Bark One](https://video.tonybark.com) is a personal and friends only YouTube-like video sharing site based on [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/). It has no intentions on being the next [Justin.tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv), let alone a competitor to YouTube. It's goals are more similar to [Nebula](https://watchnebula.com/) in that it's mostly to get away from YouTube's ads and recommendation algorithms.

However, because PeerTube is federated, other instances or people can follow Video Bark One or me, respectfully, and vice versa. Many instances follow mine already because I added it to a public list but Video Bark One only follows only a selected few, based on my own interests. This keeps things fresh while still preserving what's been locally uploaded.

<!-- Recently (and I do mean *recently*), PeerTube added support for live streaming. -->
