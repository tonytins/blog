[Video Bark One](https://video.tonybark.com) is a personal and friends only YouTube-like video sharing site based on [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/). It has no intentions on being the next [Justin.tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin.tv), let alone a competitor to YouTube. It's goals are more similar to [Nebula](https://watchnebula.com/) in that it's mostly to get away from YouTube's ads and recommendation algorithms.

However, because PeerTube is federated, other instances or people can follow Video Bark One or me, respectfully, and vice versa. Many instances follow mine already because I added it to a public list but Video Bark One only follows only a selected few, based on my own interests. This keeps things fresh while still preserving what's been locally uploaded.

Personally, as much as I love YouTube, I've stopped using it to share my content publicly in the past and only recent got back into sharing ny [FUSER videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxacRvNidv_8JVGihhdC-2ehzaxrllmd). I use to be more active on my [old channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/zc456) but with everyone forced to fight over the recommendation algorithms now, and the fact it's been used as a tool to [literally overthrow the government](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2021/01/09/trump-twitter-ban-rudy-giuliani-youtube-podcast-video-removed/6611765002/), it just doesn't feel worth it anymore in the long run. It's too big for it's own good. And while, yes, you could argue that PeerTube is even less regulated than YouTube, that all depends on the instance. If it's self hosted by yourself or a organization, such as [Blender](https://video.blender.org/), than I'd expect those to be heavily regulated versus one that's public but that's just me.
